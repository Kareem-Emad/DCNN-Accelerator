some notes about cache
-image is directly after the first filter - first channel
-image height then width then pixels
-max value or width counter = image width -1
-counters work on risig edge and registers and cache latch on falling edge
-max reached signal of the counter was 1 for just instanc so instead latch it in another signal
-to read from memory increment at the start so that the out of the counter is MY ADDRESS

-now i'm trying to exit when = width => worked
